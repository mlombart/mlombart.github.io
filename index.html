										How giant planets form is one of the biggest challenges of modern astronomy. Indeed, understanding how giant planets are formed, how they evolve and interact, is critical since they shape the planetary system architectures and therefore the possibility of forming telluric planets capable of hosting life. Protoplanetary discs, composed of gas and dust are supposed to be the cradle of planet formation. The theories of planet formation have drastically evolved to include constraints from observations.</p>
									<p align="justify">
										My research interests lie on the dust evolution in protoplanetary discs (dust growth and dust settling), the early stage of planet formation and on observations of giant planets by direct imaging (SPHERE/VLT).

											<p> 
												Planets can form in less than a few million years in protoplanetary discs. <b>How the dust growth can be so efficient ? </b> Numerical models that include gas and dust have subsequently been developed to interpret observations of discs (e.g. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.451..974D"> Dipierro et al. 2015</a>; <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...860..124D" >Dong et al. 2018</a>; <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...885...91D" >Dr&aogon;żkowska et al. 2019</a>). However, no three dimensional (3D) dust and gas simulations have yet included dust coagulation and fragmentation comprehensively so far, although it can not be neglected (e.g. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005A&A...434..971D"> Dullemond & Dominik 2005</a>; <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007A&A...461..215O"> Ormel et al. 2007</a>; <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008A%26A...480..859B">Brauer et al. 2008</a>; <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A%26A...513A..79B"> Birnstiel et al. 2010</a>; <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010Icar..209..836K"> Kobayashi et al. 2010</a>; <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014prpl.conf..339T"> Testi et al. 2014</a>). This is mainly due to the prohibitive computational cost associated with the resolution of the Smoluchowski equation (coagulation/fragmentation equation) with existing numerical algorithms. Efficiently and accurately solving this non-linear integro-differential equation is one of the grand challenges of planet formation (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PASA...33...53H" > Haworth et al., 2016</a>). Indeed, numerical integration of the Smoluchowski equation is challenging since grain sizes from 1 μm to 1 cm span 12 orders of magnitude in mass. Current numerical models require a large number of mass sampling points to avoid artificial formation of large mass aggregates (e.g. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1969JAtS...26.1060K" >Kovetz & Olund 1969</a>; <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001JPhA...3410219L"> Lee 2001</a>; <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A%26A...513A..79B"> Birnstiel et al. 2010</a>), which is computationally expensive.

												My Ph.D thesis focused on elaborating an algorithm solving the coagulation/fragmentation equation with three main constraints: 
											</p>
											<ul>
                           			<li> 12 orders of magnitude in mass, </li>
                           			<li> an accuracy of order 0.1% to be consistent with hydrodynamic solvers, </li>
                           			<li> a small number of dust size bins. </li>
                        			</ul>
											<p>
												A typical number of 10 − 20 dust size bins was targeted to perform 3D simulations of real dusty discs with the PHANTOM code (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PASA...35...31P">Price et al., 2018</a>), compared to the 10<sup>2</sup> − 10<sup>3</sup> bins used so far in current algorithms (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990Icar...83..205O"> Ohtsuki et al., 1990</a>; <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A%26A...513A..79B"> Birnstiel et al. 2010</a>). Artificial diffusion may become particularly important when a large mass interval is sampled with a small number of bins (see k=0 on figure). To address this challenge, I developed a new high-order scheme based on the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/17M1150360"> Liu et al., 2019</a>) to fulfil the stringent criteria set by the astrophysical constraints.

											<p align="justify" style=" font-size: 80%;"> Numerical solution for constant kernel test case with 20 bins (note the 16 orders of magnitude in mass on the y axis in log). The major part of the total mass of the system is located around the maximum of the curve. Numerical diffusion is drastically reduced in the exponential tail as the order of the scheme increases. Order 3 can achieve an improvement in accuracy of a factor 100 compared to order 0 in the exponential tail (Lombart et al., 2020, MNRAS, accepted with minor revisions).</p>

                           	This high-order discontinuous Galerkin algorithm can fulfil requirements from hydrodynamics constraints and couple the coagulation equation in a realistic 3D dust and gas simulation of protoplanetary discs (Lombart et al., 2020, MNRAS, accepted with minor revisions). First tests with the PHANTOM code will be performed next year in collaboration with Pr. D. J. Price. The algorithm is designed in a modular way to be used in other hydrodynamic codes used in the community. This work was done at CRAL/ENS de Lyon with my Ph.D advisor Dr. Guillaume Laibe.

												In protoplanetary discs, micron-sized grains play an important role since they dominate the thermal balance, carry charges, and are thus sensitive to magnetic fields. An accurate description of the vertical distribution of dust grains is required to interpret comprehensively the SPHERE observations. A seminal model where grains are scattered by turbulent diffusivity has been developed by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995Icar..114..237D" > Dubrulle et al. (1995)</a> and extended by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007Icar..192..588Y"> Youdin & Lithwick (2007) </a>, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A&A...496..597F" > Fromang & Nelson (2009)</a>, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJS..190..297B" >Bai & Stone (2010)</a>, and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.485.5221L" >Lin (2019)</a>. I collaborated with Dr. G. Laibe and Dr. C-E. Bréhier to derive an analytic formula for the distribution of small grains that encompass gas stratification, dust inertia, and finite correlation times in protoplanetary discs <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.5134L"> (Laibe et al., 2020)</a>. My contribution to this work was to develop the code to solve the system of stochastic differential equations and perform the convergence analysis of the simulations. The numerical scheme is the Monte-Carlo method coupled to a Strang splitting method. The code is parallelized (OpenMP) to achieve high-accuracy with the Monte-Carlo method in a tractable computational time. The analytic formula is then validated against numerical simulations.

									<h4>Direct imaging of planets with SPHERE</h4>

												A majority of recent discoveries of imaged giant planets have been obtained around young, dusty, early-type stars (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008Sci...322.1348M"> Marois et al., 2008</a>; <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010Sci...329...57L" >Lagrange et al., 2010</a>). Following the strategy of the NaCo DUSTIES survey (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A&A...553A..60R" >Rameau et al., 2013</a>) and the discovery of HD 95086 b, I worked with Dr. G. Chauvin and Pr. P. Rojo on the complete analysis of a direct imaging survey to determine the probability of detection of giant planets around young nearby stars hosting multi-belt systems. I analysed data from the SPHERE/VLT extreme Adaptive Optics (xAO) planet imager obtained with the Open Time Program DUSTIES. I led the follow-up survey in band J2-J3 required to confirm an eventual planet detection. No new exoplanets were found. I could however set robust constraints on the presence of giant planets around observed stars (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...639A..54L" > Lombart et al., 2020</a>). This work paves the way to future observations of this survey with the next generation of instruments (SPHERE+, JWST and ELT).

The positions of the inner and the outer debris belts are shown in orange by shading the regions inside the inner and beyond the outer. Our mass contrast limits are based on SPHERE/IRDIS and COND model predictions. Dynamical mass constraints for a slightly closer planet spacing of 20 mutual Hill radii from <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.462L.116S"> Shannon et al.
